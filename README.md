# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
In this project I used javascript and plotly to create an interactive dashboard that gives information 
about bacteria samples collected from each research subjects belly button. The page does not initialize
properly to patient 1940 when the page is loaded.  This will be fixed in a future revision.  The charts
do populate when a patient id is selected.
